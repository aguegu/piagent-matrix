# Releases

## 0.2.0 (2026-08-28)

Hardening pass over the agent path, plus the plumbing needed to run the bot
unattended on more than one host.

### Breaking Changes

* Other processes no longer open their own Matrix client. `scripts/hourly-stats.mjs` is removed; senders spool a file into `OUTBOX_DIR` and the running bot delivers it. Two clients on one crypto store desynchronise the Megolm ratchet
* `OUTBOX_DEFAULT_ROOM` is gone. The bot records a **main room** — the first room it is invited to — in `data/main-room.json`. `MATRIX_MAIN_ROOM` pins one if the recorded room is wrong
* pi credentials come from `PI_AGENT_DIR` (default `${DATA_DIR}/pi`), not `~/.pi/agent`. Existing deployments must authenticate a provider there
* `BOT_CWD` is required and defaults to `/tmp/piagent-workspace` in the committed `.env`; the bot refuses to start without it. The old default was `process.cwd()`, which for this repo is the directory holding its own credentials
* Agent replies are sent with `format: org.matrix.custom.html` and a `formatted_body`
* Package renamed `tradebots-matrix-v2` -> `piagent-matrix`, and marked `private`

### New Features

* **Main room** (`src/main-room.js`): the bot's control channel, adopted from the first room it joins and recorded on disk. Join order cannot be recovered from `getJoinedRooms()`, so it is observed at join time. One existing room is adopted at startup; several means it refuses to guess. Read per send, so a bot invited after it started needs no restart
* **Outbox** (`src/outbox.js`): a spool the running bot watches, so cron jobs and scripts can post without touching the crypto store. `*.txt` goes to the main room, `*.json` takes `{ room?, body, html? }`. Writers `rename()` in, so a partial file is never read; drops process in filename order; failures park as `.failed`; anything spooled while the bot was down goes out on the next start
* **Markdown rendering** (`src/markdown.js`): markdown-it with `html: false`, then sanitize-html down to the tags Matrix clients render. Tool lines bypass it, since `_` and `*` in JSON arguments would be read as emphasis
* The agent is told its room id and the outbox protocol on the first prompt of each session, so "post a report here every hour" is answerable
* `PI_AGENT_DIR`: pi's auth, model cache, settings, skills and extensions live with the bot, so it works as a service account or in a container

### Fixes

* **Megolm ratchet desynchronisation.** A second process sharing the crypto store advanced its own copy of the ratchet, emitting different plaintexts at the same `message_index` (observed 7 → 5 → 6 → 7, then 9 twice). Strict clients reject the duplicate as a replay; FluffyChat showed "undecryptable" where Element did not
* **Agent errors terminated the bot.** `handleMessage` rethrew into an `async` EventEmitter listener, which neither awaits nor catches, so Node exited on the unhandled rejection. Contained at the boundary, plus a process-level backstop
* **A second message in one room got no reply.** pi's `prompt()` queues and returns immediately when the session is already streaming, so the caller rendered an empty buffer while its answer replaced the first message's text. Runs are serialized per room
* **A failed session was cached and replayed.** A rejected creation promise stayed in the map, so a room that failed once reported that same error forever — fixing the cause changed nothing until a restart
* **Prose before a tool call was discarded.** The reply buffer was assigned rather than appended, and each assistant message's `partial` covers only itself. Replies are now blocks in event order
* `tool_execution_end` annotated the last tool line rather than the most recent unfinished one
* Authentication instructions named the wrong variable: pi reads `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`, not this project's `PI_AGENT_DIR`, so the documented command wrote credentials where the bot could not find them — and the runtime error repeated that command back
* The "no provider" error now distinguishes a missing `auth.json` from an empty one from unusable credentials. Both pi and this bot write `{}` at startup, so the file existing means nothing
* `~/.pi/agent` is no longer presented as pi's fixed default; it comes from `piConfig.configDir` in whichever build is running

### Improvements

* Per-room backlog cap with an explicit refusal, rather than an invisible queue
* `waitUntilIdle()` before prompting, so a still-streaming session cannot produce a silent no-op
* Loaded extensions are logged, and failures reported — previously both were silent
* `npm run cross-sign` no longer buries its result in ~250 lines of SDK logging that ended in abort noise (`VERBOSE=1` restores it)
* Known-noisy `M_NOT_FOUND` probes filtered from the log
* `createSession` injection seam on `AgentManager`, which is what makes the agent testable

### Documentation

* README rewritten around what the project is, with an ordered **Getting started** walkthrough and a troubleshooting table mapping each startup error to the step that fixes it
* `SECURITY.md`: the agent's operational blast radius first, then an assessment of the `npm audit` advisories — all from `matrix-bot-sdk` depending on the deprecated `request`, unfixable upstream and unreachable from this bot's code paths
* MIT `LICENSE`. The repo previously declared ISC in `package.json` with no licence file, which on a public repo means nobody may legally use it
* `docs/pi-integration.md`: how pi is wired in and the API behaviour that is easy to get wrong
* `docs/web-search-tools.md`: corrected — those tools come from the `pi-web-access` extension, not pi's core
* `docs/blog/`: two posts, on verification and on handing a codebase between agents
* The committed `.env` is a template again; site-specific values live in `.env.local`
* Documented that `@matrix-org/matrix-sdk-crypto-nodejs` needs its `postinstall` — it ships no binary, so a blocked install script leaves the bot unable to start

### Tests

* 33 tests with `node:test`, the first in this repo: agent serialization, session-failure recovery, reply rendering, markdown sanitisation, outbox routing and refusal paths, main-room adoption
* Each fake was checked against the bug it covers — run against the pre-fix code, they fail

## 0.1.0 (2026-08-26)

Rewrite onto `matrix-bot-sdk`, replacing the `matrix-js-sdk` bot that could not
persist crypto across restarts.

### New Features

* Matrix bot on matrix-bot-sdk with a file-based rust crypto store (SQLite), so device keys survive restarts. The previous stack offered only indexeddb or in-memory, and there is no indexeddb in Node — every boot minted a new Olm account
* End-to-end encryption, handled transparently for encrypted and unencrypted rooms
* Device cross-signing via `npm run cross-sign`, which reads the account's existing self-signing key from secret storage rather than resetting the identity
* `config` + `dotenv-flow`: `.env` committed as a template, `.env.local` for real values
* pi-coding-agent wired in, one session per room
* Per-room session persistence under `SESSION_DIR`, so conversation memory survives restarts
* `PI_MODEL` / `PI_THINKING_LEVEL` / `BOT_CWD` documented in the committed `.env`
* Typing indicator and read receipts as progress feedback
* Allowlist via `MATRIX_ALLOWED_USERS`

### Fixes

* Timeline handler uses `getId()` and tolerates non-`MatrixEvent` objects
* Known-noisy `M_NOT_FOUND` HTTP errors filtered from log output — the encryption-state probe returns 404 for unencrypted rooms
